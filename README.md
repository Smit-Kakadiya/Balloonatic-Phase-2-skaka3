# The Balloonatic Assylum Phase 2

In this repository, I have implemented phase 2 of the Balloonatic Asylum project in which I have gone over Node, Express, EJS and JSON with some front-end web based technologies. I also attached snapshots of all modules that will be used to understand every page with proper validation and flow. In order to run this project into your system, please download this repository and follow below steps that shows how to install EJS and Express into your system.

## Step 1: Install EJS
```bash
$ npm install ejs
```
## Step 2: Install Express
```bash
$ npm install express
```
## Step 3: Run main controller (server.js)
```bash
$ node server.js
```
If you get `Error: Cannot find module cookie-parser` then you also need to install cookie-parser module as I used this module to store user login/ logout data.
## Step 4: Install Cookie Parser
```bash
$ npm install cookie-parser
```
## Step 5: Again run main coltroller (server.js)
```bash
$ node server.js
```
